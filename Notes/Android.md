## **What is Android?**

**Android** is an open-source operating system based on Linux, primarily designed for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.  
It provides a rich application framework for developers to build innovative apps that can run on a wide range of devices.

**Key Features of Android:**

- Open-source and customizable.
- Supports multitasking and background services.
- Large developer community and resources.
- Compatibility with various hardware and form factors.

---

## **Dalvik Virtual Machine & .apk File Extension:**

### **Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM):**

- The **Dalvik Virtual Machine** is a special virtual machine designed to run Android applications.
- It’s optimized for low memory and power consumption, which is essential for mobile devices.
- The Dalvik VM executes **.dex** (Dalvik Executable) files, which are converted from Java bytecode during the build process.

### **APK File Extension:**

- Android applications are packaged in **.apk (Android Package)** format.
- The **.apk** file contains all the necessary files, resources, and metadata required to run an Android application, including:
  - Application code (`.dex` files).
  - Resources (images, layouts, etc.).
  - AndroidManifest.xml file.
  - Libraries and other assets.

---

## **Fundamentals of Android: Basic Building Blocks**

### **1. Activities:**

- An **Activity** is a single screen in an application with which users can interact.
- An application may have one or more activities that represent different screens or pages (e.g., Home screen, Settings screen).
- The Activity lifecycle controls how the system creates, resumes, and destroys activities.
- Example: A login screen can be one activity, while a home screen can be another.

### **2. Services:**

- **Services** are components that run in the background to perform long-running tasks.
- Services do not interact directly with the user but handle tasks like playing music, downloading files, or managing network communication.
- They can run indefinitely, even if the user switches to a different app.
- Example: Music playing in the background while using another app.

### **3. Broadcast Receivers:**

- **Broadcast Receivers** allow applications to listen for and respond to system-wide broadcast messages, such as notifications for incoming calls, battery status, or Wi-Fi status changes.
- They help apps react to system events or other apps’ actions.
- Example: An app that listens for changes in network connectivity.

### **4. Content Providers:**

- **Content Providers** allow apps to access and modify data from other applications or share their own data with other apps.
- They act as an abstraction layer for accessing data stored in databases, files, or other storage locations.
- Example: Accessing contacts from the device’s Contacts app.

---

## **UI Components: Views & Notifications**

### **1. Views:**

- Views are the basic UI components that interact with the user.
- Android provides several **View** types for building interfaces:
  - **TextView:** Displays text.
  - **Button:** Represents a clickable button.
  - **ImageView:** Displays images.
  - **EditText:** Provides a text field for user input.
  - **ListView:** Displays a list of scrollable items.

### **2. Notifications:**

- **Notifications** are used to alert users about important information even when they are not using the app.
- Notifications appear in the system tray, and the user can interact with them to launch activities or services.
- Example: A notification for a new message or a calendar reminder.

---

## **Components for Communication: Intents & Intent Filters**

### **1. Intents:**

- **Intents** are messages that allow communication between different components of an Android application (like activities, services, and broadcast receivers).
- An intent can be used to start an activity, start a service, or send a broadcast message.
- Example: An Intent to open the camera or send an email.

### **2. Intent Filters:**

- **Intent Filters** define the types of intents that a component is able to handle.
- They are declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
- Example: A Broadcast Receiver that listens for system events like device boot-up.

---

## **Android API Levels (Versions & Version Names):**

Android versions are categorized into **API levels** to ensure backward compatibility with previous versions. Each new release is assigned an API level, and developers use this to check compatibility.

### **Key Android Versions and their API Levels:**

1. **Android 1.5 (Cupcake)** – API Level 3
2. **Android 2.0 (Eclair)** – API Level 5
3. **Android 2.3 (Gingerbread)** – API Level 9
4. **Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)** – API Level 14
5. **Android 5.0 (Lollipop)** – API Level 21
6. **Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)** – API Level 23
7. **Android 7.0 (Nougat)** – API Level 24

Here’s your **semester-style answer** for **Unit 2: Environment Setup and Basic Project Structure**, Suraj:

---

# **Unit 2: Environment Setup and Basic Project Structure**

---

## **Setting Up Development Environment for Android:**

To begin developing Android applications, you need to set up the development environment, which includes the following:

1. **Install Android Studio:**  
   Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development, which provides tools like code editors, debuggers, and a powerful emulator.  
   Steps:

   - Download and install Android Studio from the official website.
   - Install the necessary Android SDKs and tools during the setup process.

2. **Install Android SDK (Software Development Kit):**  
   The SDK provides tools, libraries, and APIs required to develop Android applications.

3. **Set up Emulator:**  
   The Android Emulator mimics Android devices on your computer, allowing you to test apps without needing a physical device.
   - Create a new virtual device using AVD Manager in Android Studio.

---

## **Manifest.xml:**

The **AndroidManifest.xml** file is a crucial component of every Android application. It declares essential information about the app to the system, such as:

- **Application components:** Activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers.
- **Permissions:** Declares the permissions the app needs (e.g., accessing the internet, reading contacts).
- **App metadata:** Defines the app theme, version, and package name.

**Key components in the Manifest:**

- `<uses-permission>`: Declares required permissions (e.g., internet access).
- `<uses-sdk>`: Specifies the minimum and target SDK versions.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="16" android:targetSdkVersion="29" />
```

---

## **Gradle:**

**Gradle** is a build automation tool used in Android projects. It automates the process of compiling code, creating APK files, and managing dependencies.

- The **build.gradle** file defines the configuration for building the app, such as dependencies and SDK versions.
- **Example:**

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 29
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.helloworld"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 29
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
}
```

---

## **Uses-Permission & Uses-SDK:**

- **`<uses-permission>`** is used to request permissions from the user, allowing the app to access specific system resources, like the internet or camera.

  Example:

  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
  ```

- **`<uses-sdk>`** specifies the minimum and target SDK versions that the app supports.

  Example:

  ```xml
  <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="16" android:targetSdkVersion="29" />
  ```

---

## **Resources & R.java:**

In Android, **resources** (like images, strings, and layouts) are stored in the **res** folder.

- **`res/layout`** contains XML files defining the app’s UI layout.
- **`res/drawable`** contains image resources (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- **`res/values`** contains resource files like strings, colors, and styles.

The **R.java** file is auto-generated by the Android build system and contains references to all the resources in the app.

For example:

```java
String appName = getString(R.string.app_name);
```

---

## **Assets:**

The **assets** folder is used to store raw files like fonts, HTML files, or any custom data that the app needs.

- Files in **assets** are accessed as a raw stream using the `AssetManager`.

Example:

```java
AssetManager assetManager = getAssets();
InputStream inputStream = assetManager.open("data.txt");
```

---

## **Layouts & Drawable Resources:**

- **Layouts:** Define the structure of the app's user interface. These XML files describe UI components like buttons, text fields, and images.

Example layout file (`activity_main.xml`):

```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">
    <TextView android:text="Hello World!"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
</LinearLayout>
```

- **Drawable Resources:** Contain image files, including vector images and raster images, used in the UI.

Example (`res/drawable/ic_launcher.png`).

---

## **First Sample Application:**

### **Creating the First Android App (Hello World):**

1. Open Android Studio and create a new project.
2. Set the **application name**, **package name**, and **project location**.
3. Choose a template (e.g., **Empty Activity**).
4. Android Studio will automatically generate the necessary files, including `MainActivity.java` and `activity_main.xml`.
5. In the `activity_main.xml` file, create a simple `TextView`:

```xml
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/textView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Hello World!" />
```

6. In `MainActivity.java`, reference the `TextView`:

```java
TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.textView);
textView.setText("Hello World!");
```

---

## **Launching Emulator:**

The **Android Emulator** allows you to simulate Android devices on your PC to run your application.

- To launch the emulator:
  1. Open **AVD Manager** from Android Studio.
  2. Create a new virtual device (e.g., Pixel 4).
  3. Choose the system image (Android version).
  4. Start the emulator.

---

## **Editing Emulator Settings:**

To change the emulator's settings, click on the **Settings** icon in the **AVD Manager**. You can adjust:

- RAM and storage allocation.
- Device specifications (screen size, resolution).
- Device orientation.

---

## **Emulator Shortcuts:**

Common **Emulator Shortcuts** include:

- **Ctrl + F11:** Rotate the emulator screen.
- **Ctrl + F12:** Simulate power button press.
- **Esc:** Simulate the back button.

---

## **Logcat Usage:**

**Logcat** is used for logging messages from your app. It's invaluable for debugging.

- You can view **Logcat** in Android Studio’s bottom panel, which shows logs for system messages, app errors, and custom log messages.
- To log messages in your code:

```java
Log.d("MainActivity", "Hello World");
```

---

## **Introduction to DDMS (Dalvik Debug Monitor Service):**

DDMS is a tool for monitoring and debugging Android applications. It provides features such as:

- Viewing log messages.
- Monitoring device performance.
- Taking screenshots of the emulator/device.

---

## **Debugging the Android App:**

Android Studio offers powerful debugging tools:

- **Breakpoints:** Set breakpoints in your code to pause execution at specific lines.
- **Step Through:** You can step through your code line by line to examine variables and the flow of execution.
- **Watch Variables:** Monitor specific variables during execution.
- **Run/Debug Configuration:** Choose which emulator or physical device to deploy your app to.

Would you like me to create a **quick reference guide** for the basic project structure and resources (like `R.java`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, etc.) for a fast revision?  
Let me know if I should prepare that!

Here’s your **semester-style answer** for **Unit 3: Android Fundamentals and User Interface Design**, Suraj:

---

# **Unit 3: Android Fundamentals and User Interface Design**

---

## **Activities and Activity Lifecycle:**

### **Activities in Android:**

An **Activity** represents a single screen in an Android app. It serves as the entry point for user interaction with the app and typically corresponds to a window in the graphical user interface.

**Key points about Activities:**

- Each Activity is given a unique task to accomplish.
- It manages the UI and responds to user inputs.
- There can be multiple Activities in an app (e.g., Home Activity, Settings Activity, etc.).

### **Activity Lifecycle:**

The **Activity Lifecycle** refers to the different states an activity can be in, from when it’s first created to when it’s destroyed. The system calls different lifecycle methods depending on the state of the activity.

**Key Lifecycle Methods:**

- **onCreate():** Called when the activity is first created. Here, the UI is set up.
- **onStart():** Called when the activity is about to become visible to the user.
- **onResume():** Called when the activity starts interacting with the user.
- **onPause():** Called when the system is about to resume another activity.
- **onStop():** Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.
- **onDestroy():** Called when the activity is about to be destroyed.

Understanding the Activity lifecycle is crucial for managing resources and maintaining app performance.

---

## **Permission System:**

The **Android Permission System** allows apps to request access to sensitive system resources, like the internet, camera, or location data.

**Key Permissions:**

- **Normal Permissions:** These permissions do not pose significant risk to the user (e.g., setting wallpaper).
- **Dangerous Permissions:** These permissions can access sensitive user data (e.g., camera, contacts).

**Manifest Declaration:**
Permissions are declared in the **AndroidManifest.xml** file.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

**Runtime Permissions:** Starting from Android 6.0 (API level 23), permissions must be requested at runtime for certain dangerous permissions.

Example code to request permission:

```java
if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.CAMERA)
    != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
    ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.CAMERA}, 1);
}
```

---

## **Basic UI Components:**

1. **TextView:**

   - Displays text on the screen.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <TextView android:id="@+id/textView"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content"
       android:text="Hello World!" />
   ```

2. **Button:**

   - Represents a clickable button.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <Button android:id="@+id/button"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content"
       android:text="Click Me" />
   ```

3. **RadioButton:**

   - Used in groups for single-choice selection.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <RadioGroup>
       <RadioButton android:id="@+id/radioButton1"
           android:layout_width="wrap_content"
           android:layout_height="wrap_content"
           android:text="Option 1" />
   </RadioGroup>
   ```

4. **EditText:**

   - A field that allows users to input text.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <EditText android:id="@+id/editText"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content"
       android:hint="Enter text" />
   ```

5. **ImageView:**

   - Displays images on the screen.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <ImageView android:id="@+id/imageView"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content"
       android:src="@drawable/sample_image" />
   ```

6. **CheckBox:**

   - Allows users to select/deselect an option.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <CheckBox android:id="@+id/checkBox"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content"
       android:text="Accept Terms and Conditions" />
   ```

7. **ProgressBar:**
   - Displays a progress indicator, useful for showing the progress of a task.
   - Example:
   ```xml
   <ProgressBar android:id="@+id/progressBar"
       android:layout_width="wrap_content"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content"
       android:indeterminate="true" />
   ```

---

## **Event Handling in Android:**

Event handling allows the app to respond to user actions like clicks, touches, and gestures. Common event listeners include:

- **OnClickListener:** For buttons and other clickable components.
- **OnTouchListener:** For handling touch gestures.

Example:

```java
Button button = findViewById(R.id.button);
button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        // Handle button click
    }
});
```

---

## **Layouts:**

Android provides several **layout types** that define the structure of UI components on the screen:

1. **LinearLayout:**

   - Aligns UI components in a single horizontal or vertical line.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <LinearLayout android:orientation="vertical">
       <TextView android:text="Hello" />
       <Button android:text="Click Me" />
   </LinearLayout>
   ```

2. **RelativeLayout:**

   - Allows UI components to be positioned relative to each other.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <RelativeLayout>
       <TextView android:id="@+id/textView" android:text="Hello" />
       <Button android:layout_below="@id/textView" android:text="Click Me" />
   </RelativeLayout>
   ```

3. **FrameLayout:**

   - Simplest layout; it stacks all components on top of each other.
   - Example:

   ```xml
   <FrameLayout>
       <TextView android:text="Hello" />
       <Button android:text="Click Me" />
   </FrameLayout>
   ```

4. **ConstraintLayout:**
   - A flexible layout that allows you to create complex layouts without nesting.
   - Example:
   ```xml
   <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
       <TextView android:id="@+id/textView" android:text="Hello" />
       <Button android:id="@+id/button" android:text="Click Me" />
   </androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
   ```

---

## **Unit of Measurement: dip, dp, sip, sp, and px:**

- **dp (density-independent pixel):** Used for defining UI components that should be independent of screen density.
- **dip:** Equivalent to dp, and is used interchangeably.
- **sp (scale-independent pixel):** Like dp, but also scaled by the user’s font size preference (used for text sizes).
- **px (pixels):** Physical pixels on the screen, not scalable.

For consistent UI design, it's recommended to use **dp** and **sp** instead of **px** to ensure the app looks good on devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions.

---

## **Intents:**

### **Introduction and Importance of Intents:**

**Intents** are used in Android to request an action from another component of the app or from another app. They allow for communication between components, such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers.

### **Types of Intents:**

1. **Explicit Intents:**

   - Directly specifies the target component (usually an activity).
   - Example: Navigating from one activity to another in the same app.

   ```java
   Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
   startActivity(intent);
   ```

2. **Implicit Intents:**
   - Does not specify the target component. Instead, it declares an action, and the system decides which app or component can handle the action.
   - Example: Sharing data, opening a webpage, or making a phone call.
   ```java
   Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("http://www.example.com"));
   startActivity(intent);
   ```

Would you like me to provide a **visual diagram** showing the Activity lifecycle or the different types of layouts for quicker understanding? Let me know if I should prepare that!

Here’s your **semester-style answer** for **Unit 4: Menus and Preferences**, Suraj:

---

# **Unit 4: Menus and Preferences**

---

## **Introduction to Menus:**

Menus in Android are essential UI elements that allow users to interact with the app by offering various options. Android provides several types of menus to enhance user navigation and facilitate different actions within the application.

Menus are created using XML files or by programmatically defining menu items in the app. They appear as part of the activity or context in which the user interacts.

---

## **Types of Menus:**

### 1. **Options Menu:**

The **Options Menu** is the primary menu in Android, typically accessed by tapping the **Menu button** (or the three-dot overflow icon in modern devices). This menu is used for actions that affect the overall app or current activity. It is shown when the user clicks the action bar (or menu button, depending on the Android version).

- **When to use:** Actions such as "Save," "Search," or "Settings."
- **Example:**

  ```java
  @Override
  public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
      getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.menu_main, menu); // Inflates the menu from XML
      return true;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
      switch (item.getItemId()) {
          case R.id.action_settings:
              // Handle settings action
              return true;
          default:
              return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
      }
  }
  ```

**Menu XML example (res/menu/menu_main.xml):**

```xml
<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:id="@+id/action_settings"
        android:title="Settings"
        android:orderInCategory="100"
        android:showAsAction="never"/>
</menu>
```

### 2. **Context Menu:**

The **Context Menu** is a secondary menu that appears when the user **long-presses** on a UI element (e.g., a list item, button, or image). This menu is typically used for actions related to specific content or elements within the app.

- **When to use:** Actions like "Delete," "Edit," or "Share," which are related to the specific content selected by the user.
- **Example:**

  ```java
  @Override
  public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {
      super.onCreateContextMenu(menu, v, menuInfo);
      getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.menu_context, menu);
  }

  @Override
  public boolean onContextItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
      switch (item.getItemId()) {
          case R.id.action_edit:
              // Handle edit action
              return true;
          case R.id.action_delete:
              // Handle delete action
              return true;
          default:
              return super.onContextItemSelected(item);
      }
  }
  ```

**Context Menu XML example (res/menu/menu_context.xml):**

```xml
<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <item android:id="@+id/action_edit"
        android:title="Edit" />
    <item android:id="@+id/action_delete"
        android:title="Delete" />
</menu>
```

To register a view for a context menu:

```java
registerForContextMenu(view);
```

---

## **Uses of Shared Preferences:**

**Shared Preferences** are used for storing small amounts of data (such as user settings, app preferences, or application state) that should persist between app sessions. Shared Preferences save data in key-value pairs and are typically used for storing simple data like strings, integers, booleans, and floats.

### **When to use Shared Preferences:**

- Storing user preferences (e.g., theme settings, language choice).
- Storing login credentials (if not using a more secure storage solution).
- Storing app-specific configurations.

### **Working with Shared Preferences:**

1. **Accessing Shared Preferences:**
   Shared Preferences are accessed using the `getSharedPreferences()` method.

```java
SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", MODE_PRIVATE);
```

2. **Saving Data:**
   You can save data to Shared Preferences using the `SharedPreferences.Editor` class.

```java
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
editor.putString("username", "Suraj");
editor.putInt("user_age", 25);
editor.apply(); // Commit the changes
```

3. **Retrieving Data:**
   To retrieve data, use the `getString()`, `getInt()`, etc., methods from `SharedPreferences`.

```java
String username = sharedPreferences.getString("username", "default_name");
int age = sharedPreferences.getInt("user_age", 0);
```

4. **Removing Data:**
   To remove specific data, use the `remove()` method.

```java
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
editor.remove("username");
editor.apply();
```

5. **Clearing All Data:**
   To clear all stored preferences, use the `clear()` method.

```java
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
editor.clear();
editor.apply();
```

### **Example Use Case:**

Imagine you are building an app where the user can select their theme preference (Light or Dark). You can use Shared Preferences to store the selected theme so it persists between app launches.

```java
// Save preference
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
editor.putString("theme", "dark");
editor.apply();

// Retrieve preference
String theme = sharedPreferences.getString("theme", "light");
if (theme.equals("dark")) {
    // Apply dark theme
} else {
    // Apply light theme
}
```

---

## **Conclusion:**

Menus in Android provide a great way to organize and present user actions. By utilizing **Option Menus** and **Context Menus**, you can create an intuitive navigation structure within your app. Meanwhile, **Shared Preferences** offer a simple way to store user settings and data that need to persist across sessions.

Would you like me to provide some **additional examples** or explore a **particular menu type** or **Shared Preferences use case** in more detail? Let me know if you need further explanations!

  ```

You can handle user selections in your activity as follows:

```java
DatePicker datePicker = findViewById(R.id.datePicker);
int day = datePicker.getDayOfMonth();
int month = datePicker.getMonth();
int year = datePicker.getYear();
```

For TimePicker:

```java
TimePicker timePicker = findViewById(R.id.timePicker);
int hour = timePicker.getCurrentHour();
int minute = timePicker.getCurrentMinute();
```

## **ListView:**

### **ListView:**

The **ListView** is a view group that displays a list of items. It is commonly used to display a long list of data, like contacts or messages.

- **XML Layout for ListView:**

  ```xml
  <ListView android:id="@+id/listView"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
  ```

- **Populating ListView:**
  You need an adapter to populate the list. **ArrayAdapter** is one of the simplest adapters.

  ```java
  ListView listView = findViewById(R.id.listView);
  String[] data = {"Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"};
  ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, data);
  listView.setAdapter(adapter);
  ```

---

## **GridView:**

### **GridView:**

A **GridView** is similar to a **ListView**, but it displays items in a two-dimensional grid, often used for showing images or a collection of data in rows and columns.

- **XML Layout for GridView:**

  ```xml
  <GridView android:id="@+id/gridView"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:numColumns="auto_fit"
      android:columnWidth="80dp"
      android:horizontalSpacing="10dp"
      android:verticalSpacing="10dp" />
  ```

- **Populating GridView:**
  You can use an **ArrayAdapter** or **BaseAdapter** to populate the grid.
  ```java
  GridView gridView = findViewById(R.id.gridView);
  String[] items = {"Image 1", "Image 2", "Image 3"};
  ArrayAdapter<String> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, items);
  gridView.setAdapter(adapter);
  ```

---

## **CardView:**

### **CardView:**

The **CardView** provides a material design-style card with rounded corners, a shadow, and a subtle elevation effect. It is used to represent information in a visually appealing way.

- **XML Layout for CardView:**
  ```xml
  <androidx.cardview.widget.CardView
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      app:cardCornerRadius="8dp"
      app:cardElevation="4dp">
      <LinearLayout
          android:layout_width="match_parent"
          android:layout_height="match_parent">
          <TextView android:text="Card Content" />
      </LinearLayout>
  </androidx.cardview.widget.CardView>
  ```

**Note:** To use CardView, add the following dependency in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0'
```

---

## **RecyclerView:**

### **RecyclerView:**

The **RecyclerView** is a more flexible and efficient version of **ListView**. It is used for displaying large data sets in a list or grid format. It allows for better performance and more complex item layouts.

- **RecyclerView Layout:**

  ```xml
  <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
      android:id="@+id/recyclerView"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
  ```

- **RecyclerView Adapter:**
  A **RecyclerView.Adapter** is responsible for binding data to the views in the **RecyclerView**.

  ```java
  RecyclerView recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.recyclerView);
  MyAdapter adapter = new MyAdapter(data);
  recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
  ```

- **ViewHolder Pattern:**
  To improve performance, RecyclerView uses the **ViewHolder** pattern. This avoids frequent `findViewById` calls.

  ```java
  public class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
      TextView textView;

      public MyViewHolder(View itemView) {
          super(itemView);
          textView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.textView);
      }
  }
  ```

---

## **Dialogs:**

### **Dialogs:**

Dialogs in Android are used to present information or get input from the user in a small, interactive window.

- **AlertDialog:**
  Used for showing alerts and getting simple user input.

  ```java
  new AlertDialog.Builder(this)
      .setTitle("Alert")
      .setMessage("This is an alert message.")
      .setPositiveButton("OK", null)
      .setNegativeButton("Cancel", null)
      .show();
  ```

- **Custom Dialogs:**
  You can create custom dialogs by inflating your own layout inside a `Dialog`.
  ```java
  LayoutInflater inflater = getLayoutInflater();
  View customView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.custom_dialog, null);
  new AlertDialog.Builder(this)
      .setView(customView)
      .setPositiveButton("OK", null)
      .show();
  ```

---

## **Toast:**

### **Toast:**

A **Toast** is a small, non-interactive message that appears on the screen for a short period of time. It is used to display feedback to the user.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  Toast.makeText(this, "Hello, world!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  ```

---

## **Popup:**

### **PopupMenu:**

A **PopupMenu** is a menu that appears on the screen at a specific location (e.g., after a button click).

- **Example:**
  ```java
  PopupMenu popupMenu = new PopupMenu(this, view);
  MenuInflater inflater = popupMenu.getMenuInflater();
  inflater.inflate(R.menu.menu_popup, popupMenu.getMenu());
  popupMenu.show();
  ```

---

## **Fragments:**

### **Fragments:**

**Fragments** are reusable UI components that can be combined to create multi-pane layouts for devices with large screens (e.g., tablets). A fragment represents a portion of the UI in an activity.

- **Creating a Fragment:**

  ```java
  public class MyFragment extends Fragment {
      @Override
      public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
          return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_layout, container, false);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Adding Fragments to Activity:**
  ```java
  FragmentTransaction transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
  MyFragment fragment = new MyFragment();
  transaction.add(R.id.fragment_container, fragment);
  transaction.commit();
  ```

---

## **Material Design:**

### **Introduction to Material Design:**

**Material Design** is a design language developed by Google, focusing on creating a consistent and intuitive user experience across all devices. It emphasizes bold colors, subtle shadows, and natural motion.

### **Key Components of Material Design:**

1. **Navigation Drawer:**
   A **Navigation Drawer** allows users to navigate between different sections of an app using a slide-out menu.

   ```java
   ActionBarDrawerToggle toggle = new ActionBarDrawerToggle(this, drawerLayout, toolbar, R.string.open, R.string.close);
   drawerLayout.addDrawerListener(toggle);
   toggle.syncState();
   ```

2. **Floating Action Button (FAB):**
   The **FAB** is a button that performs a primary action in the app. It typically floats above the UI and is used for actions like creating a new item.

   ```xml
   <androidx.coordinatorlayout.widget.CoordinatorLayout
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="match_parent">
       <com.google.android.material.floatingactionbutton.FloatingActionButton
           android:id="@+id/fab"
           android:layout_width="wrap_content"
           android:layout_height="wrap_content"
           android:src="@drawable/ic_add" />
   </androidx.coordinatorlayout.widget.CoordinatorLayout>
   ```

3. **Toolbar:**
   The **Toolbar** is an enhanced ActionBar that can hold buttons, titles, and other content. It provides a consistent navigation interface at the top of the screen.
   ```xml
   <androidx.appcompat.widget.Toolbar
       android:id="@+id/toolbar"
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
   ```

Would you like me to provide a **detailed implementation example** for any of these advanced components or help with a **specific UI component** in your app? Feel free to let me know!

Here’s your **semester-style answer** for **Unit 6: Threads in Android**, Suraj:

---

# **Unit 6: Threads in Android**

---

## **Threads Running on UI Thread (Run on UI Thread):**

In Android, the **UI thread** (also known as the **Main thread**) is responsible for handling UI updates and user interactions. Since Android does not allow long-running operations to be performed on the UI thread (as it can cause the app to freeze or become unresponsive), operations such as network requests, file I/O, or heavy computations should be executed on separate threads.

### **UI Thread Operations:**

- The UI thread is used to update the UI elements, process user input, and respond to lifecycle events.
- You should avoid long operations on the UI thread to prevent the **ANR (Application Not Responding)** error.

### **Example:**

```java
// UI thread (Main thread)
TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.textView);
textView.setText("Hello, world!");
```

---

## **Worker Thread:**

A **Worker Thread** runs in the background and performs long-running tasks such as network calls, database operations, or file handling. Worker threads should be used for operations that would block the UI thread.

To create a worker thread, you can extend the `Thread` class or implement the `Runnable` interface.

### **Creating a Worker Thread:**

```java
Thread workerThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Perform background work here
    }
});
workerThread.start();
```

In this example, the `run()` method contains the long-running operation that will be executed on the background thread.

---

## **Handlers & Runnable:**

Android provides **Handlers** to manage and communicate between threads, especially for updating the UI from a background thread. The **Handler** allows posting messages or **Runnable** objects to the UI thread (main thread) for processing.

### **Using Handlers:**

A **Handler** is associated with a **Looper** (usually the UI thread) and allows you to send messages or tasks to be executed on that thread.

#### **Creating a Handler to update UI:**

```java
Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());
handler.post(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Update UI here (on the UI thread)
        textView.setText("Background task completed");
    }
});
```

### **Runnable:**

A **Runnable** is an interface that represents a task that can be executed by a thread.

You can create a **Runnable** and post it to the **Handler** for execution on a specific thread.

```java
Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Perform background task
    }
};
handler.post(runnable);  // Execute the Runnable on the UI thread
```

---

## **AsyncTask:**

`AsyncTask` is a built-in class in Android for performing background operations and updating the UI. It allows you to execute tasks in the background and then update the UI once the task is completed, without needing to manually manage threads.

### **AsyncTask Life Cycle:**

1. **onPreExecute():** Runs before the background task starts. It runs on the UI thread.
2. **doInBackground():** Runs in the background thread and is used for long-running operations (networking, file I/O).
3. **onProgressUpdate():** Runs on the UI thread, used to update progress during background work.
4. **onPostExecute():** Runs after the background task is completed, updates the UI with the result.

### **AsyncTask Example:**

```java
private class MyTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Integer, String> {

    @Override
    protected void onPreExecute() {
        super.onPreExecute();
        // Setup UI before task starts
    }

    @Override
    protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {
        // Perform background work (e.g., network operation)
        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);  // Simulate work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return "Task Completed!";
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
        super.onPostExecute(result);
        // Update UI with result
        textView.setText(result);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... values) {
        super.onProgressUpdate(values);
        // Update progress
    }
}
```

To execute the task:

```java
new MyTask().execute();
```

### **AsyncTask vs. Other Threads:**

`AsyncTask` is generally used for tasks where you need to update the UI after completing a background task. It is simpler than using `Thread` and `Handler` explicitly but has limitations, such as it should not be used for tasks that need to run for a long duration (like large file downloads).

## **Calling Web Services and Consuming JSON Data:**

### **Making Network Calls in Android:**

To call a web service (e.g., a REST API), you typically use libraries like **HttpURLConnection**, **Retrofit**, or **OkHttp**. These libraries facilitate making HTTP requests and handling responses asynchronously.

Here’s an example of how to use **HttpURLConnection** to make a network request and parse JSON data:

### **Making a Network Call:**

```java
private class NetworkTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {
    @Override
    protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://api.example.com/data");
            HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
            connection.connect();

            InputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
            StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                response.append(line);
            }
            reader.close();
            return response.toString();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return null;
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
        super.onPostExecute(result);
        if (result != null) {
            // Parse the JSON data
            try {
                JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(result);
                String value = jsonObject.getString("key");
                textView.setText(value);
            } catch (JSONException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **Consuming JSON Data:**

- **JSON Parsing:**
  After receiving the JSON response, you can parse it using **JSONObject** or **Gson** to extract data.

**Using JSONObject:**

```java
String jsonResponse = "{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }";
try {
    JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(jsonResponse);
    String name = jsonObject.getString("name");
    int age = jsonObject.getInt("age");
} catch (JSONException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

**Using Gson:**

```java
Gson gson = new Gson();
User user = gson.fromJson(jsonResponse, User.class);
```

Where `User` is a model class representing the JSON structure.

```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

---

## **Conclusion:**

Handling background operations efficiently in Android is crucial for maintaining app performance and responsiveness. By using **Worker threads**, **Handlers**, **AsyncTask**, and properly managing network operations with web services, you can ensure that your app remains smooth and responsive.

# **Unit 7: Notifications & Services**

---

## **Broadcast Receivers**

### **Introduction to Broadcast Receivers:**

In Android, a **BroadcastReceiver** is a component that allows applications to listen for and respond to broadcast messages from other applications or from the system. These broadcast messages can be system events (e.g., Wi-Fi status changes, battery status changes) or custom events defined by the application.

### **Different Ways to Register a Broadcast Receiver:**

1. **Static Registration (in the AndroidManifest.xml):**

   - A **BroadcastReceiver** can be registered statically in the **AndroidManifest.xml** file. This registration method is useful for receiving system-wide broadcasts like **Wi-Fi status changes**, **battery low**, etc.

   **Example (Manifest Registration):**

   ```xml
   <receiver android:name=".MyBroadcastReceiver">
       <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
       </intent-filter>
   </receiver>
   ```

   - The above code registers a receiver that listens for the **BOOT_COMPLETED** broadcast (when the system finishes booting).

2. **Dynamic Registration (in code):**

   - You can also register a **BroadcastReceiver** dynamically using the **registerReceiver()** method within your activity or service. This allows the receiver to be registered at runtime and unregistered when no longer needed.

   **Example (Dynamic Registration):**

   ```java
   MyBroadcastReceiver receiver = new MyBroadcastReceiver();
   IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED);
   registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
   ```

   - Here, the receiver listens for the **AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED** event.

3. **Unregistering a Broadcast Receiver:**

   - To prevent memory leaks or unwanted behavior, it is important to unregister the receiver when it is no longer needed.

   **Example (Unregister):**

   ```java
   unregisterReceiver(receiver);
   ```

## **Introduction to Notification**

### **What are Notifications?**

A **Notification** is a message or alert that appears outside the context of the current application to provide the user with information or updates. Notifications can appear in the status bar, lock screen, or as a pop-up.

### **Components of a Notification:**

- **Icon**: Small icon representing the notification.
- **Title**: Short title of the notification.
- **Text**: Description or content of the notification.
- **Action**: Buttons or links to perform an action when clicked (optional).

### **Types of Notifications:**

1. **Basic Notification**: A simple message shown to the user.
2. **Custom Notification**: A notification with custom views or layouts.
3. **BigTextStyle Notification**: Displays large blocks of text in the notification.
4. **InboxStyle Notification**: Shows a list of messages in the notification.
5. **MediaStyle Notification**: Used for media-related notifications, like music playback controls.

### **Creating a Simple Notification:**

```java
NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);

Notification notification = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification)
    .setContentTitle("New Notification")
    .setContentText("Hello, this is your notification!")
    .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_DEFAULT)
    .build();

notificationManager.notify(1, notification);
```

- **CHANNEL_ID**: Required for notifications on Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above, to group notifications into channels.
- **setPriority()**: Specifies the importance level of the notification.

---

## **Overview & Types of Services**

### **What is a Service?**

A **Service** is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without a user interface. Services are ideal for tasks like downloading files, playing music, or performing database operations.

### **Types of Services:**

1. **Foreground Service:**

   - A **Foreground Service** runs with a higher priority and is less likely to be killed by the system when resources are low. It displays a persistent notification to inform the user about the ongoing task (e.g., music playback or file download).
   - **Example:**

     ```java
     Notification notification = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
         .setContentTitle("Downloading File")
         .setContentText("Download in progress...")
         .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_download)
         .build();

     startForeground(1, notification);
     ```

2. **Background Service:**

   - A **Background Service** runs without any UI and can be stopped by the system when resources are low. It does not display any persistent notifications.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Intent serviceIntent = new Intent(this, MyService.class);
     startService(serviceIntent);
     ```

3. **Bound Service:**

   - A **Bound Service** allows other components (like activities) to bind to it, interact with it, and perform operations like data retrieval or sending data.
   - The **Bound Service** is tied to an activity, and when the activity is destroyed, the service is also unbound.
   - **Example:**

     ```java
     ServiceConnection serviceConnection = new ServiceConnection() {
         @Override
         public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName name, IBinder service) {
             // Interact with the service
         }

         @Override
         public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) {
             // Handle service disconnection
         }
     };
     bindService(new Intent(this, MyService.class), serviceConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
     ```

---

## **Implementing a Service**

### **Creating a Service:**

To create a service, you need to extend the **Service** class and override its `onStartCommand()` or `onBind()` methods, depending on the service type.

- **Example of a Simple Service:**

  ```java
  public class MyService extends Service {
      @Override
      public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
          // Perform background task
          return START_STICKY;  // Service will restart if killed
      }

      @Override
      public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
          // Return binder for bound services
          return null;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Starting a Service:**

  ```java
  Intent serviceIntent = new Intent(this, MyService.class);
  startService(serviceIntent);
  ```

- **Stopping a Service:**
  ```java
  stopService(new Intent(this, MyService.class));
  ```

---

## **Service Lifecycle**

### **Life Cycle of a Service:**

1. **onCreate():** Called when the service is first created. It is used to set up any resources needed by the service.
2. **onStartCommand():** Called when a client starts the service using **startService()**. This is where the main background operation takes place.
3. **onBind():** Called when a component (e.g., activity) binds to the service using **bindService()**.
4. **onUnbind():** Called when all clients unbind from the service.
5. **onDestroy():** Called when the service is no longer needed and is being destroyed. You can clean up resources here.

### **Service Lifecycle Example:**

```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    // Initialize the service
}

@Override
public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
    // Perform background operation
    return START_STICKY;  // Indicates the service should restart if killed
}

@Override
public void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    // Cleanup resources when the service is destroyed
}
```

### **Binding and Unbinding a Service:**

If the service is bound, you can interact with it through **onBind()**, and it will remain running as long as there are active clients.

- **Binding a Service:**

  ```java
  bindService(new Intent(this, MyService.class), serviceConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
  ```

- **Unbinding a Service:**
  ```java
  unbindService(serviceConnection);
  ```

---

## **Conclusion:**

In this unit, we have learned about **BroadcastReceivers**, **Notifications**, and **Services** in Android. BroadcastReceivers allow for listening to system-wide or custom events, while Notifications help notify users about important events or updates. **Services** run tasks in the background and provide flexibility in handling different operations, either as a **foreground service**, **background service**, or **bound service**.

If you need more details on any of these concepts or specific examples for implementing them in your app, feel free to ask!

Here’s your **semester-style answer** for **Unit 8: Storage and Content Provider**, Suraj:

# **Unit 8: Storage and Content Provider**

---

## **Supported Storage in Android**

### **1. Internal Memory:**

- **Internal Storage** is used to store private data for an application. It is stored in a private folder and cannot be accessed by other apps unless explicitly shared.
- Files stored in internal storage are **secure** because they are sandboxed and cannot be read by other apps.
- When the app is uninstalled, all files in internal storage are deleted.

#### **Example:**

```java
FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput("example.txt", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
fos.write("Hello, Internal Storage!".getBytes());
fos.close();
```

### **2. External Memory:**

- **External Storage** includes both **removable** (e.g., SD cards) and **non-removable** (e.g., device storage that appears as an external drive) storage options.
- It is used to store large files, such as images, videos, or music, that can be accessed by other apps or the user.
- **External Storage** requires **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** and **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** permissions.

#### **Example:**

```java
File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "example.txt");
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
fos.write("Hello, External Storage!".getBytes());
fos.close();
```

### **3. Shared Preferences:**

- **Shared Preferences** are used to store simple key-value pairs of data, such as settings or small amounts of user data. It is typically used for saving configuration or preferences.
- Data stored in **SharedPreferences** is persistent across app sessions.

#### **Example:**

```java
SharedPreferences preferences = getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
editor.putString("username", "Suraj");
editor.putInt("age", 21);
editor.apply();
```

- To retrieve data:

```java
String username = preferences.getString("username", "defaultName");
int age = preferences.getInt("age", 0);
```

### **4. Network Storage:**

- **Network Storage** refers to saving data on remote servers or cloud platforms, such as **Firebase**, **AWS**, or **Google Drive**.
- It is used for syncing data between multiple devices or for accessing data that is shared between users.

## **SQLite Introduction**

### **What is SQLite?**

- **SQLite** is a lightweight, relational database engine used for storing structured data in an app. It is embedded directly within the app and does not require a network connection.
- SQLite is useful for apps that require structured data storage but do not need a full-fledged database server.

### **Creating an SQLite Database:**

- You create an SQLite database by using the `SQLiteOpenHelper` class. This class helps in managing database creation, upgrading, and version management.

#### **Example:**

```java
public class MyDatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
    private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "mydb";
    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;

    public MyDatabaseHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
        String createTable = "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)";
        db.execSQL(createTable);
    }

    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
        db.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users");
        onCreate(db);
    }
}
```

### **Opening the Database:**

```java
MyDatabaseHelper dbHelper = new MyDatabaseHelper(this);
SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
```

---

## **CRUD Operations in SQLite Database**

### **1. Insert Data (Create):**

- To insert data into the database, use `ContentValues` to store key-value pairs.

#### **Example (Insert):**

```java
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
values.put("name", "Suraj");
values.put("age", 21);
long rowId = db.insert("users", null, values);
```

### **2. Query Data (Read):**

- To retrieve data, use the `query()` method which returns a `Cursor` object. The `Cursor` is used to access the rows of the result set.

#### **Example (Query):**

```java
Cursor cursor = db.query("users", new String[] {"id", "name", "age"}, null, null, null, null, null);
if (cursor != null) {
    cursor.moveToFirst();
    do {
        String name = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex("name"));
        int age = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex("age"));
    } while (cursor.moveToNext());
    cursor.close();
}
```

### **3. Update Data (Update):**

- To update existing records, use the `update()` method.

#### **Example (Update):**

```java
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
values.put("age", 22);
int rowsAffected = db.update("users", values, "name = ?", new String[] {"Suraj"});
```

### **4. Delete Data (Delete):**

- To delete records, use the `delete()` method.

#### **Example (Delete):**

```java
int rowsDeleted = db.delete("users", "name = ?", new String[] {"Suraj"});
```

## **Basics of Content Provider**

### **What is a Content Provider?**

A **Content Provider** is a component that manages access to a structured set of data. It acts as an intermediary between different applications, allowing them to share and query data securely.

Content Providers are commonly used for accessing data in **SQLite databases**, files, or other apps' data, ensuring data security and consistency.

### **Content Provider Lifecycle:**

- A **ContentProvider** is defined by extending the `ContentProvider` class and implementing its methods.
- Some key methods include:
  - **onCreate()**: Called when the provider is created.
  - **query()**: Retrieves data from the provider.
  - **insert()**: Inserts data into the provider.
  - **update()**: Updates data in the provider.
  - **delete()**: Deletes data from the provider.
  - **getType()**: Returns the MIME type of the data.

### **Example of a Simple Content Provider:**

```java
public class MyContentProvider extends ContentProvider {
    private static final String AUTHORITY = "com.example.mycontentprovider";
    private static final Uri CONTENT_URI = Uri.parse("content://" + AUTHORITY + "/users");

    @Override
    public boolean onCreate() {
        // Initialize the content provider
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public Cursor query(Uri uri, String[] projection, String selection, String[] selectionArgs, String sortOrder) {
        SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getReadableDatabase();
        return db.query("users", projection, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, sortOrder);
    }

    @Override
    public Uri insert(Uri uri, ContentValues values) {
        SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
        long id = db.insert("users", null, values);
        return ContentUris.withAppendedId(CONTENT_URI, id);
    }

    @Override
    public int update(Uri uri, ContentValues values, String selection, String[] selectionArgs) {
        SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
        return db.update("users", values, selection, selectionArgs);
    }

    @Override
    public int delete(Uri uri, String selection, String[] selectionArgs) {
        SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
        return db.delete("users", selection, selectionArgs);
    }

    @Override
    public String getType(Uri uri) {
        return "vnd.android.cursor.dir/vnd.com.example.mycontentprovider.users";
    }
}
```

To access the content provider, you would use a `ContentResolver`:

```java
ContentResolver resolver = getContentResolver();
Cursor cursor = resolver.query(CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);
```

## **Conclusion:**

In this unit, we explored various storage options in Android, including **Internal Storage**, **External Storage**, **SharedPreferences**, and **Network Storage**. We also learned about **SQLite** for local database storage and performed **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQLite. Lastly, we introduced **Content Providers**, which enable apps to share and access data securely, providing an essential mechanism for inter-app data communication.
