2. **Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory**:

   - **Herzberg** identified two factors that impact motivation:
     - **Hygiene Factors**: These are external factors (e.g., salary, working conditions) that do not lead to long-term satisfaction but prevent dissatisfaction.
     - **Motivators**: These are intrinsic factors (e.g., achievement, recognition) that lead to long-term satisfaction and motivation.

3. **Douglas McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y**:
   - **Theory X**: Assumes that employees are inherently lazy and need to be closely supervised and controlled.
   - **Theory Y**: Assumes that employees are self-motivated and seek responsibility and opportunities for growth.
   - McGregor’s theory emphasizes the importance of managerial attitude toward employees in motivating them.

# **Unit 8: Basics of Accounting and Finance**

---

## **8.1 Basics of Accounting**

### **Meaning and Definition of Accounting**

**Accounting** refers to the systematic process of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions to provide useful information for decision-making. It involves the preparation of financial statements, such as balance sheets and income statements, to show the financial performance and position of an entity.

The main purpose of accounting is to ensure that all financial information is accurately recorded, reported, and analyzed, allowing stakeholders (investors, managers, creditors) to make informed decisions.

**Definition**:
Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions in a way that provides relevant information to users for decision-making.

### **Double Entry System of Bookkeeping**

The **double-entry system** is the foundation of modern accounting. According to this system, every financial transaction affects at least two accounts: one account is debited, and another is credited. The total debits always equal the total credits, ensuring that the accounting equation remains balanced.

The basic accounting equation is:

\[
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Owner's Equity}
\]

In this system:

- **Debit** entries represent an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities and equity.
- **Credit** entries represent an increase in liabilities or equity or a decrease in assets.

### **Trading Account**

The **trading account** is a financial statement used to calculate the **gross profit** or **gross loss** of a business. It focuses on the direct costs associated with the production of goods and services, including the cost of goods sold (COGS), which is subtracted from sales revenue.

The formula for gross profit is:

\[
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Net Sales} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}
\]

Key components of the trading account include:

- **Sales Revenue**: The total income from the sale of goods or services.
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs associated with the production or acquisition of goods sold.
- **Opening Stock**: Inventory at the beginning of the accounting period.
- **Purchases**: Goods bought for resale or manufacturing.
- **Closing Stock**: Inventory remaining at the end of the accounting period.

### **Profit and Loss Account (PLA)**

The **Profit and Loss Account (PLA)**, also known as the income statement, shows the **net profit** or **net loss** of a business after deducting indirect expenses from gross profit. It helps determine the overall profitability of an organization.

The key components include:

- **Gross Profit** (from Trading Account)
- **Operating Expenses**: Salaries, rent, utilities, and other indirect costs.
- **Other Income**: Income from non-operational activities like interest or dividends.
- **Net Profit or Net Loss**: The final result after accounting for all revenues and expenses.

### **Balance Sheet of a Company**

The **balance sheet** provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It lists the company's assets, liabilities, and equity, ensuring that the accounting equation remains balanced:

\[
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Owner's Equity}
\]

The balance sheet is divided into two main sections:

- **Assets**: Everything the company owns (current and non-current).
  - **Current Assets**: Cash, receivables, and inventory that are expected to be converted into cash within one year.
  - **Non-Current Assets**: Long-term investments, property, plant, and equipment.
- **Liabilities**: Everything the company owes (current and long-term).
  - **Current Liabilities**: Obligations due within one year (e.g., accounts payable, short-term loans).
  - **Non-Current Liabilities**: Long-term debts or obligations (e.g., bonds payable).
- **Owner’s Equity**: The residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities (e.g., capital, retained earnings).

## **8.2 Objectives of Financial Management**

### **Profit Maximization vs. Wealth Maximization**

Two major objectives of financial management are **profit maximization** and **wealth maximization**. These objectives guide financial decision-making within an organization.

### **Profit Maximization**

Profit maximization focuses on increasing the **net profit** of the company in the short term. The objective is to enhance the company's ability to generate profit, which in turn leads to an increase in earnings available to shareholders.

Key features:

- Short-term focus: Profit maximization aims at achieving higher profits in a given period.
- It is measured using metrics like net profit or earnings before tax (EBT).
- The risk associated with this approach is that it may ignore the long-term sustainability and the risk factors involved in decision-making.

### **Wealth Maximization**

Wealth maximization, also referred to as **value maximization**, aims to maximize the **long-term value** of the company for its shareholders. The focus is on increasing the **market value** of the company, as reflected by its stock price. This approach considers both profits and risks over the long term and aims to ensure the company’s sustainability and growth.

Key features:

- Long-term focus: Wealth maximization emphasizes value creation over time.
- It is measured using metrics like **market value**, **shareholder wealth**, and **return on investment (ROI)**.
- This approach considers both **return and risk**, ensuring that decisions made by the company lead to an increase in shareholder wealth.

---

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, accounting provides the framework for tracking financial transactions and preparing financial statements like the trading account, profit and loss account, and balance sheet. Financial management, on the other hand, involves making strategic decisions based on the objectives of **profit maximization** and **wealth maximization** to ensure long-term growth and sustainability of an organization. By balancing these objectives, companies can effectively manage their finances, increase shareholder wealth, and achieve long-term success.
