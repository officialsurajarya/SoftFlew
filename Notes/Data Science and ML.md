# **Unit 2: Data Preprocessing, Analysis, and Visualization**

---

## **1. Data Pre-processing**

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data science pipeline that prepares raw data for analysis or machine learning. It involves transforming data into a clean and usable format. The quality of data preprocessing significantly impacts the performance of machine learning models.

### **Pre-processing Techniques:**

#### **1.1 Mean Removal (Mean Centering)**:

- **Mean removal** is a technique used to normalize data by subtracting the mean of each feature from the feature’s values.
- This helps to center the data around zero, making it easier for many machine learning algorithms to work efficiently.

  **Formula:**
  \[
  \text{New Value} = \text{Original Value} - \text{Mean of the Feature}
  \]

  **Example:**

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
  ```

#### **1.2 Scaling (Feature Scaling)**:

- Scaling is a technique used to normalize the range of independent variables. It ensures that no feature dominates over others due to its scale.
- **Standard Scaling** (z-score normalization) and **Min-Max Scaling** are the most common scaling methods.

  - **Standard Scaling** (z-score normalization): Transforms data to have zero mean and unit variance.
  - **Min-Max Scaling**: Scales the data to a specific range (typically [0, 1]).

  **Example of Min-Max Scaling:**

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
  scaler = MinMaxScaler()
  scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
  ```

#### **1.3 Normalization**:

- **Normalization** refers to adjusting values in a dataset to a common scale, typically [0, 1], by scaling the values.
- It is essential for distance-based models like k-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and clustering algorithms.

#### **1.4 Binarization**:

- **Binarization** converts data into binary (0 or 1) values, typically used when the data needs to be treated as categorical or to simplify the dataset for certain models.
- It is useful for transforming numerical features into binary features.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import Binarizer
  binarizer = Binarizer(threshold=0.0)
  binary_data = binarizer.transform(data)
  ```

#### **1.5 One-Hot Encoding**:

- **One-Hot Encoding** is used for converting categorical variables into a binary matrix.
- Each category is represented as a vector of zeros with a single one indicating the category.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
  encoder = OneHotEncoder()
  encoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(categorical_data)
  ```

#### **1.6 Label Encoding**:

- **Label Encoding** is a technique used to convert categorical labels into numerical form (integer values).
- Each unique label is assigned a unique integer. However, it should be used cautiously as the model might misinterpret the numerical relationships between the encoded labels.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
  encoder = LabelEncoder()
  encoded_labels = encoder.fit_transform(categorical_labels)
  ```

---

## **2. Data Analysis**

Data analysis involves loading the dataset, summarizing the data, and understanding the relationships between different features. The goal is to uncover useful patterns, trends, and anomalies within the dataset.

### **2.1 Loading and Summarizing the Dataset**

- To load a dataset in Python, the **Pandas** library is commonly used. Once loaded, summarizing the dataset can include operations like viewing the first few records, checking data types, and identifying missing values.

  **Example (Loading Dataset using Pandas):**

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
  print(df.head())  # View first 5 rows
  ```

- **Summary Statistics**:

  - **mean()**, **std()**, **min()**, **max()**, **describe()** are used to compute summary statistics.

  ```python
  print(df.describe())  # Get summary statistics of all numeric columns
  ```

- **Missing Value Handling**:

  - Missing data can be handled by filling with mean/median or dropping the rows/columns.

  ```python
  df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Fill missing values with column mean
  ```

---

## **3. Data Visualization**

Data visualization is essential for understanding the patterns, distributions, and relationships in the data. Visualizations also help to communicate results effectively.

### **3.1 Univariate Plots**:

- **Univariate plots** display the distribution of a single variable.
- Common types of univariate plots:

  - **Histograms**: Show the distribution of a continuous variable.
  - **Box Plots**: Display the spread and outliers of the data.

  **Example (Histogram):**

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  df['column_name'].hist(bins=10)
  plt.show()
  ```

  **Example (Box Plot):**

  ```python
  df.boxplot(column='column_name')
  plt.show()
  ```

### **3.2 Multivariate Plots**:

- **Multivariate plots** are used to understand the relationship between two or more variables.

  - **Scatter Plots**: Used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.
  - **Pair Plots**: Shows relationships between all pairs of features.

  **Example (Scatter Plot):**

  ```python
  df.plot(kind='scatter', x='feature1', y='feature2', color='blue')
  plt.show()
  ```

  **Example (Pair Plot):**

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.pairplot(df)
  plt.show()
  ```

---

## **4. Training Data, Test Data, and Performance Measures**

Here’s your **semester-style answer** for **Unit 3: Statistical Inference**, Suraj:

---

# **Unit 3: Statistical Inference**

---

## **1. Populations and Samples**

### **1.1 What is a Population?**

A **population** refers to the entire set of individuals, items, or data points that we are interested in studying. It encompasses all possible members of a defined group. For example, in a study on income levels, the population could be all residents of a city or all employees of a particular company.

### **1.2 What is a Sample?**

A **sample** is a subset of the population that is selected for analysis. Since studying the entire population is often impractical, a sample is used to make inferences about the population. The sample should be representative of the population to ensure accurate conclusions.

- **Sampling Techniques**: Random sampling, stratified sampling, and systematic sampling are commonly used to ensure the sample accurately represents the population.

---

## **2. Types of Statistical Modeling**

### **2.1 Descriptive Statistics**:

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Common descriptive statistics include:

- **Measures of central tendency**: Mean, median, mode.
- **Measures of dispersion**: Variance, standard deviation, range.
- **Visualization**: Histograms, box plots, and pie charts help in representing the data visually.

### **2.2 Inferential Statistics**:

Inferential statistics is used to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample. It includes techniques such as:

- **Hypothesis testing**: Determining if there is enough statistical evidence to support a hypothesis.

---

## **3. Types of Probability Distributions**

Probability distributions describe how the values of a random variable are distributed. There are two main types of distributions: **discrete** and **continuous**.

### **3.1 Discrete Probability Distributions**:

These distributions describe random variables that take discrete values, such as integers.

- **Binomial Distribution**: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of trials with two possible outcomes (success or failure).
  - Example: The probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Describes the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate.
  - Example: The number of cars passing through a toll booth in an hour.

### **3.2 Continuous Probability Distributions**:

These distributions describe random variables that take continuous values.

- **Normal Distribution**: Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around the mean. Many natural phenomena follow this distribution.
  - Example: Heights of individuals, test scores, and IQ scores are often normally distributed.
- **Exponential Distribution**: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process, such as the time between arrivals at a service point.

  - Example: The time until the next customer arrives at a store.

- **Uniform Distribution**: Every outcome in a given range has the same probability of occurring.
  - Example: Rolling a fair die.

---

## **4. Parametric and Non-Parametric Methods**

### **4.1 Parametric Methods**:

Parametric methods make assumptions about the underlying population distribution (e.g., assuming data follows a normal distribution). These methods typically involve estimating parameters such as the mean and variance.

- **Examples of Parametric Tests**:
  - **t-test**: Used to compare the means of two groups.
  - **ANOVA**: Used to compare the means of more than two groups.
  - **Linear Regression**: Assumes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.

**Advantages**:

- Parametric methods are generally more powerful when the assumptions are met because they make full use of the data.

**Disadvantages**:

- They are sensitive to violations of the assumptions (e.g., normality of the data).

### **4.2 Non-Parametric Methods**:

Non-parametric methods do not assume a specific distribution for the population. These methods are used when the data does not meet the assumptions required for parametric tests.

- **Examples of Non-Parametric Tests**:
  - **Mann-Whitney U Test**: A test for comparing differences between two independent groups when the assumptions for a t-test are not met.
  - **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: An alternative to ANOVA for comparing more than two independent groups.
  - **Spearman’s Rank Correlation**: A non-parametric method to assess the strength and direction of the association between two variables.

**Advantages**:

- Non-parametric methods are more flexible and can be used with data that does not follow a specific distribution.

**Disadvantages**:

- These methods may be less powerful than parametric tests when the assumptions of the parametric tests are met.

---

## **5. Distance Metrics**

Distance metrics are used to measure the "distance" or similarity between data points. They are crucial in many machine learning algorithms, such as **k-NN** (K-Nearest Neighbors) and clustering methods like **k-means**.

### **5.1 Euclidean Distance**:

- Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space.
- It is the most commonly used distance metric for continuous variables.

  **Formula**:
  \[
  D(x, y) = \sqrt{ \sum\_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 }
  \]

  **Example**: Calculating the distance between two points in a 2D space.

### **5.2 Manhattan Distance** (L1 Norm):

- Also known as **taxicab distance**, it is the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.

  **Formula**:
  \[
  D(x, y) = \sum\_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|
  \]

### **5.3 Minkowski Distance**:

- A generalization of both **Euclidean** and **Manhattan** distance. The formula uses a parameter **p** to determine the type of distance:

  - When **p = 2**, it becomes Euclidean distance.
  - When **p = 1**, it becomes Manhattan distance.

  **Formula**:
  \[
  D(x, y) = \left( \sum\_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|^p \right)^{1/p}
  \]

### **5.4 Cosine Similarity**:

- Cosine similarity is used to measure the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It is widely used in text mining and natural language processing.

  **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \|y\|}
  \]

  **Example**: Measuring the similarity between two documents represented as vectors.

- Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.

#### **Disadvantages**:

- Computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Sensitive to the bandwidth parameter.

**Example**:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import MeanShift

## **3. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**

Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the number of input features in a dataset while preserving important information. These techniques are crucial for improving model efficiency and preventing overfitting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.

### **3.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

**PCA** is a technique that transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional one by finding the principal components (directions of maximum variance) in the data. It projects the data onto these components to reduce dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible.

#### **Advantages**:

- Reduces overfitting by simplifying the model.
- Helps visualize high-dimensional data.

#### **Disadvantages**:

- Loses interpretability since the new dimensions (principal components) are linear combinations of the original features.

**Example**:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
model = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = model.fit_transform(X_train)
```

## **4. Introduction to Neural Networks**

A **Neural Network** is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the brain work. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Each neuron in one layer is connected to neurons in the next layer through weighted connections.

### **4.1 Components of Neural Networks**

- **Input Layer**: Receives the input features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Process the inputs using weights and activation functions.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction.

### **4.2 Activation Functions**

Activation functions decide whether a neuron should be activated or not. Common activation functions include:

- **Sigmoid**: Outputs a value between 0 and 1.
- **ReLU**: Outputs the input directly if it is positive, else outputs 0.
- **Tanh**: Outputs values between -1 and 1.

### **4.3 Training Process**

The training process of neural networks involves forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation to adjust weights using optimization techniques like gradient descent.

#### **Advantages**:

- Can learn complex non-linear relationships in data.
- Useful for high-dimensional data, such as images and text.

#### **Disadvantages**:

- Requires large amounts of data and computational resources.
- Prone to overfitting without proper regularization.

**Example**:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

# **Unit 6: Mining Social-Network Graphs**

---

## **1. Social Networks as Graphs**

Social networks are often represented as **graphs** in data mining and machine learning. In this context, a social network is a collection of **nodes** (representing individuals, groups, or organizations) connected by **edges** (representing relationships or interactions between the nodes). The structure of these graphs reveals important patterns and insights about social dynamics, influence, and community structures.

### **Graph Representation of Social Networks**

- **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent entities such as people or groups.
- **Edges (Links)**: Represent relationships or interactions, such as friendships, follows, or communication.

For example, in a **Facebook network**, nodes represent users, and edges represent their friendships or interactions.

**Graph Example**:

```
Node A -- Node B -- Node C
```

In the above example, **A, B, and C** are nodes, and the edges connecting them represent relationships.

---

## **2. Clustering of Graphs**

**Graph clustering** is the process of grouping nodes into clusters or communities based on the structure of the graph. The goal is to identify subgraphs or communities where nodes are more densely connected within the cluster than with nodes outside it. This is particularly useful in social network analysis to identify groups with similar characteristics or behaviors.

### **Techniques for Graph Clustering**:

- **Modularity-based Clustering**: Uses the modularity measure to find clusters that maximize internal connectivity while minimizing connectivity to other clusters.
- **Spectral Clustering**: Uses the eigenvalues of the graph’s Laplacian matrix to identify clusters.
- **Label Propagation**: A fast and scalable technique where each node propagates its label to its neighbors iteratively until the labels converge.

**Example of Graph Clustering**:

```python
from networkx.algorithms import community
import networkx as nx

G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(100, 0.05)  # Creating a random graph
communities = community.greedy_modularity_communities(G)
```

---

## **3. Direct Discovery of Communities in Graphs**

**Community detection** in graphs refers to the task of identifying groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside the group. This task is fundamental for understanding social structures in networks such as online platforms, and discovering communities can provide insights into group behaviors, influence, and communication patterns.

### **Techniques for Direct Community Discovery**:

- **Girvan-Newman Algorithm**: Iteratively removes edges with the highest betweenness centrality until the graph breaks into communities.
- **Louvain Method**: Optimizes the modularity of a graph by finding hierarchical community structures in large networks.

### **Example**:

```python
import networkx as nx
from networkx.algorithms.community import girvan_newman

G = nx.karate_club_graph()  # Example graph
communities = girvan_newman(G)  # Discover communities using Girvan-Newman
```

In social networks, community detection algorithms help to identify groups such as close-knit friend circles, interest-based groups, or professional networks.

---

## **4. Partitioning of Graphs**

**Graph partitioning** is the process of dividing a graph into smaller subgraphs (or partitions) while minimizing the number of edges that cross between partitions. The goal is to break the graph into manageable pieces that are still well-connected internally. This is important in applications such as parallel processing and efficient data storage.

### **Techniques for Graph Partitioning**:

- **Min-Cut Partitioning**: Divides a graph such that the number of edges between different partitions is minimized.
- **Multilevel Partitioning**: Involves coarsing the graph to a simpler form, partitioning it, and then refining the partition on the finer levels.

**Example**:

```python
import networkx as nx
from networkx.algorithms import community

G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(100, 0.05)
partition = community.louvain_communities(G)
```

In social networks, graph partitioning can help identify subgroups based on interaction frequency or shared interests.

---

## **5. Neighbourhood Properties in Graphs**

**Neighborhood properties** in graphs refer to the characteristics of a node's direct and indirect neighbors. These properties can provide important insights into the structure and dynamics of a social network, such as community structure, influence propagation, or vulnerability to network attacks.

### **Types of Neighbourhood Properties**:

- **Degree Centrality**: Measures the number of direct connections a node has. A high degree centrality indicates a highly connected node.
- **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures how often a node appears on the shortest path between other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness centrality act as bridges in the network.
- **Closeness Centrality**: Measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. A node with high closeness centrality can spread information quickly.
- **Local Clustering Coefficient**: Measures the tendency of a node's neighbors to be connected to each other.

### **Example of Degree Centrality**:

```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.karate_club_graph()
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
```

Neighborhood properties help in identifying **influential nodes**, detecting **communities**, and understanding **information flow** in social networks.

---

## **Conclusion**

In this unit, we have explored various techniques for mining social-network graphs. Social networks are represented as graphs, and understanding their structure helps in uncovering insights into community formation, clustering, and relationships between nodes. Techniques such as **graph clustering**, **community detection**, **partitioning**, and the analysis of **neighborhood properties** are essential for understanding the complex dynamics of social networks.
